Using Hugs with the new hierarchical libraries

Most of the new libraries shipped with GHC 5.04 may also be used with
Hugs.  The main exceptions are modules related to the FFI.

Some assembly is required:
(These instructions are for Unix, I imagine cygwin is similar)

o You'll need a copy of both hslibs and libraries from CVS (see
  http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/building/sec-cvs.html
  for details on how to get this.)  Leave these two directories in
  a single directory

o in src/unix, run

	convert_libraries <directory where libraries lives>

  This will fill in libraries with converted modules, and also create
  a directory oldlib full of stubs for compatability with the old Hugs
  libraries, plus some old modules.

o back in src, run

	make install_libraries

o That's it.  Now you can run hugs with
 
	hugs -P'{Hugs}/libraries:{Hugs}/oldlib'
 
  That should be fairly compatible both with GHC 5.04 and with the older
  Hugs libraries.  If you only want compatability with GHC 5.04, you can
  drop the second directory from the path.  Some modules also need -98


More details:

o libraries/Hugs contains some Hugs-only modules (e.g. Hugs.IO), mostly
  modified versions of modules from lib.

o to see what's handled and what's not, have a look at the conversion script
  src/unix/convert_libraries.  It's quite a kludge, but it mostly works,
  though there's still plenty to do.
