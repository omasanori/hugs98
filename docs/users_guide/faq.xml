<title>Frequently Asked Questions about Hugs</title>

<para>These are some frequently asked questions about Hugs 98,
and their answers.</para>

<variablelist>

<varlistentry>
<term>What is the correct name for Hugs?</term>
<listitem>

<para>We use <quote>Hugs</quote> as a generic name for the interpreters we build.</para>

<para>We use a name like <quote>Hugs 1.3</quote>, <quote>Hugs 1.4</quote>,
or <quote>Hugs 98</quote> if we want to identify a version of Hugs that is
based on a specific version of Haskell like <quote>Haskell 1.3</quote>,
<quote>Haskell 1.4</quote>, or <quote>Haskell 98</quote>.
So please note that the <quote>1.4</quote> part in a name like
<quote>Hugs 1.4</quote> refers to the version of Haskell, and not to the
version of Hugs.</para>

<para>We use release dates to identify specific Hugs releases.
For example, if you
report a bug in the most recent release, be sure to mention that you observed
the problem with the <quote>Hugs 98, Sep 1999</quote> release.</para>
</listitem>

<varlistentry>
<term>What is the relationship between Hugs and Gofer?</term>
<listitem>

<para>Hugs is the successor to Gofer, and was originally derived from
Gofer version 2.30b.  But Hugs incorporates many changes and substantial
enhancements, and offers much greater compatibility with Haskell.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>Who is responsible for Hugs?</term>
<listitem>

<para>Mark P Jones (currently at OGI) wrote the original version of Hugs
and wrote much of the code in the current distribution.  Other Haskell
teams have also contributed to Hugs; the current distribution owes
much to other groups.  See the latest Hugs news to find out who is
doing what.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>Who do I send a bug report to?</term>
<listitem>

<para>Please send bug reports to <ulink url="mailto:hugs-bugs@haskell.org">hugs-bugs@haskell.org</ulink>.
If you send the bug report to an individual, you run the risk that that person
is on vacation, is rushing to meet a deadline or just accidentally deletes your
mail.  Sending to the mailing list gives us all a chance to reply to your bug
report.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>How do I enter function definitions?</term>
<listitem>
<para>The Hugs prompt only accepts expressions for evaluation.
You can create a file containing a Haskell module, and load that
(see <xref linkend="module-commands"/> for details).</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>How can I access more than one module at once?</term>
<listitem>
<para>Hugs has only one current module at any time,
but you can edit a module containing several <literal>import</literal>s.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>Why are non-exported names accessible at the command prompt?</term>
<listitem>

<para>When you evaluate an expression in the interpreter, it has to use some
symbol table for looking up the ids you use. What symbol table does it use?
The only credible alternatives are:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>The export list of the <quote>current module</quote>
(see the <command>:module </command> command)</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The symbol table of the <quote>current module</quote></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
Hugs uses the latter (which seems more useful) but you might reasonably
expect Hugs to use the export list and wonder why Hugs doesn't seem to
implement abstract data types correctly when you do experiments from the
command line.</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>What happened to <literal>isAlpha</literal>, <literal>toInt</literal>, etc?</term>
<listitem>
<para>The <literal>Prelude</literal> now conforms to Haskell 98,
whereas in older versions it exported some additional names.
To use character functions like <literal>isAlpha</literal>,
you must load or import the <literal>Char</literal> module.
Non-standard functions like <literal>toInt</literal> are no longer available.
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>Does Hugs implement everything in Haskell 98?</term>
<listitem>

<para>Not quite.  Mutually recursive modules are not supported yet,
and there are a few other minor discrepancies
(see <xref linkend="bugs-haskell98"/> for details).</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>Can I create executable programs with Hugs or do I always have to run
programs from the development environment?</term>
<listitem>

<para>We now include a stand-alone version of Hugs which will
<quote>load and go</quote> as well as handle command line arguments
(see <xref linkend="runhugs"/> for details).</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
