Steps to build Hugs on Windows
==============================

Here are the steps to getting Hugs to install on Windows.
You will need to be connected to the internet for all steps.

1. Install the latest MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/)
   By default this will install to c:\MinGW

2. Install the latest MSYS (http://www.mingw.org/)
   During the MSYS installation, a console application will ask
   you where you installed MinGW. Make sure you give it the correct path.
   Do not try to install MSYS and MinGW into the same folder.
   By default this will install to c:\msys\1.0

3. Download and install MSYSdtk
   Install into the same directory as you installed MSYS.

4. Download Bison 2.0 from the MinGW website.
   Extract it into your msys-1.0 directory, so that bison.exe ends up in
   your MSYS "bin" folder. Use "tar -zxf" to extract it; DO NOT USE WinZip,
   unless you know how to control newline conversion in WinZip.

5. Start the MSYS shell, using the shortcut that gets installed into the
   Start menu.
   Type "gcc --version". The first line should say "mingw-special":
         gcc.exe (GCC) 3.4.2 (mingw-special)
   Type "bison --version" to verify bison was extracted correctly.

6. Checkout the latest CVS release of Hugs.

7. Change to the Hugs directory.

8. Type "cvs -d `cat CVS/Root` login"
   Enter the password of "cvs"

9. Type "make distclean" and "make".
   Sit back and wait a long time.


Using Microsoft Visual C++
--------------------------

Building the libraries needs a Unix-like environment, as described
above, but once you've done that you can build the interpreter and
WinHugs using MSVC.

Open the project files located in msc and winhugs.
Clicking on compile should build the projects.
