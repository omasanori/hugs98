An overview of Hugs configuration

We use GNU's autoconf to determine the configuration of the target platform.

[Note: all configuration scripts should be run from the directory containing
 the script - but I'll use full paths when discussing scripts so that you
 can find them.]

On Unix, all you have to do is run hugs/src/configure.

   This runs many small tests on the compiler, preprocessor, linker, etc
   to determine how your system is configured.  It combines this with any
   configuration flags to generate these files
     hugs/src/Makefile   -- used to control compilation
     hugs/src/config.h   -- #included into every Hugs module
     hugs/src/options.h  -- #included into every Hugs module

Other platforms can't run the configure scripts directly - and so the
instructions vary according to which system you're using:

Windows/DOS
~~~~~~~~~~~

On Windows/DOS, you can only run the configuration scripts if you have
the cygnus tools installed (version 16beta; version 17 seems to have a
bug that crashes the configure script).  Even if you have the tools
installed, the configuration script won't run directly because:

1) The configure script uses Unix features like /dev/null that don't
   exist on DOS.
2) The configure script assumes that C compilers follow Unix traditions
   when interpreting their command arguments.  All DOS compilers we've tried
   use radically different syntax for their command line arguments.

To overcome these problems, the files

  hugs/src/{msc,bcc32,bcc16,win32,win16,djgpp2}/config.sh

contain scripts which make the configure scripts run (through a
combination of patching the configure script, override default values,
etc).  [The djgpp2 script crashes near the end - however, the results
it prints up to that point are useful for creating configuration files
by hand.]

In fact, we rarely run these scripts directly.  Instead, we run

  hugs/src/unix/mkconfigs

which runs all the scripts with appropriate arguments and makes copies
of the generated files (Makefile, config.h and options.h) in
appropriate subdirectories.  These copies are for the benefit of
people who can't run the configure scripts directly.  They cannot be
expected to match all machines perfectly (since the configuration
script only checked what was happening on my machine) - but they
chould be pretty close and they are well commented.  (I don't think
it's possible to do any better - without writing a version of autoconf
which works on all DOS machines.) The prebuilt copies are stored in
subdirectories of hugs/src and can be installed by running one of

  hugs/src/{msc,bcc32,bcc16,win32,win16,djgpp2}/config.bat

(If you're running bash, "cmd <config.bat" does the right thing.)

Modifying the configure script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're modifying Hugs or porting it to a new platform, you might
need to extend the configure script.  The steps are:

1) Get a recent copy of autoconf.  (We use version 2.10.)
2) Read the autoconf documentation. 
   (If all you need to do is test whether /usr/include/sys/foo.h
   exists - you can probably figure it out without reading the docs.)
3) Edit hugs/src/unix/configure.in in whatever way you like.
4) Run hugs/src/unix/mkconfig.
   This uses autoconf to generate hugs/src/unix/configure and 
   it uses autoheader to generate hugs/src/config.h.in
5) Send patches to hugs-bugs@cs.yale.edu (please).
