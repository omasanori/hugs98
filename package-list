# This file contains all packages which are handled via darcs-all. Every line
# contains:
#
#  * The name of a package or a full URL of the darcs repository. In the
#    latter case, the package name is the last path component of the URL.
#
#  * Its status, i.e. if it is a "core" or "extra" package. Core packages
#    are always retrieved, extra packages only when darcs-all is given the
#    --extra option.
#
#  * The version of the package to retrieve a release version. Normally the
#    most recent version is retrieved, but with darcs-all's --release option,
#    the given version of a package is retrieved via wget/curl from Hackage.
#
# Following the usual *nix conventions for configuration files, empty lines or
# lines starting with a "#" are ignored.
