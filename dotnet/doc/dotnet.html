<h1>Hugs98 for .NET</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

Hugs98 for .NET is an extension of the <a href="http://haskell.org/hugs">Hugs98</a>
Haskell interpreter, providing good interoperation between the world of Haskell
and the world of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/">.NET</a> and
the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/">.NET Framework</a>.
<p>
The <a href="http://haskell.org/hugs/">Hugs98</a> interpreter has been
extended with features which lets you instantiate and use .NET objects
from within Haskell, and vice versa, allows you to call and use
Haskell functions from any .NET language.
<p>
The motivation behind this work is entirely pragmatic -- I want to
be able to use a great language on an important, new platform laden
with many great features and libraries. In contrast with other
attempts at integrating functional languages with the .NET platform,
Hugs98 for .NET takes a hands-off approach, providing 'just' the ability
to interoperate well with .NET. That is, it does not try to compile
Haskell into .NET's IL and have the .NET run-time execute it. Instead
the Hugs98 interpreter operates side-by-side with the .NET run-time,
providing code in either world with just the ability to call code in
the other.

<h2>Example</h2>

To give a flavour of what's possible with Hugs98 for .NET, here's 
how to fetch a URL into a Haskell String:

<pre>
fetchURL :: String -> IO String
fetchURL url = do
  req <- invokeStatic "System.Net.WebRequest" "Create" url
  when (isNullObj req)
       (ioError (userError ("Unable to fetch " ++ show url)))
  rsp <- req # invoke "GetResponse" ()
  str <- rsp # invoke "GetResponseStream" ()
  str # slurpString
</pre>

See the documentation and the distribution, which contains this
example and many others, for details of what this code is doing.

<h2>Download</h2>

A Windows Installer containing Hugs98 and the .NET extensions is
available via <a href="http://galois.com/~sof/hugs98.net/hugs98-net.msi">http</a>.
You need to have either Visual Studio .NET or the .NET Framework SDK
installed to use Hugs98 for .NET.
<p>
A source release is forthcoming.

<h2>Documentation</h2>

For documentation on Haskell, see <a href="http://haskell.org/">haskell.org</a>.
<p>
The distribution includes documentation on how to interop with the
.NET platform, but is also available in on-line form:

<ul>
<li>The DotNet library <a href="dotnet-lib.html">documentation</a>.
<li>Brief <a href="examples.html">overview</a> of samples included in distribution.
</ul>

<h2>Authors</h2>

Info on authors and maintainers of Hugs98 can be found via
its <a href="http://haskell.org/hugs">homepage</a>.

<p>
The .NET extensions are by <a href="http://galois.com/~sof/">Sigbjorn
Finne</a>, with helpful input and encouragement from <a
href="http://research.microsoft.com/~emeijer/">Erik Meijer</a>.
