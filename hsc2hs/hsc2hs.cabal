Synopsis: A preprocessor that helps with writing Haskell bindings to C code.
Description:
	The hsc2hs program can be used to automate some parts of the
	process of writing Haskell bindings to C code.	It reads an
	almost-Haskell source file with embedded special constructs, and
	outputs a real Haskell file with these constructs processed, based
	on information taken from some C headers.  The extra constructs
	provide Haskell counterparts of C types, values of C constants,
	including sizes of C types, and access to fields of C structs.
	.
	Actually hsc2hs does not output the Haskell file directly.  It
	creates a C program that includes the headers, gets automatically
	compiled and run.  That program outputs the Haskell code.
