   We are pleased to announce a new  release of Hugs98, a  Haskell
   interpreter and programming environment for developing cool
   Haskell programs.  Sources and binaries are freely available
   by anonymous FTP and on the World-Wide Web.

   This release is largely conformant with Haskell 98, including
   monad and record syntax, newtypes, strictness annotations, and
   modules.  In addition, it comes packaged with the libraries defined
   in the most recent version of the Haskell Library Report and with
   extension libraries that are compatible with GHC 3.0 and later.

   This is purely a bug-fix release of Hugs98 Nov99. 
   It fixes the following problems:
     - If you defined an instance which inherited a method via a
       superclass, hugs would go into an infinite loop.  Fortunately,
       most people weren't doing this (except Chris Okasaki...).
     - There were a couple of holes in the implementation of implicit
       parameters (`with' wasn't always being scoped properly,
       sometimes capturing implicit parameters outside of its scope).
     - Functional dependencies weren't being properly propogated in
       some cases with derived instances (`instance P ... => Q ...').
 
   Hugs is best used as a Haskell program development system: it boasts
   extremely fast compilation, supports incremental compilation, and
   has the convenience of an interactive interpreter (within which one
   can move from module to module to test different portions of a
   program).  However, being an interpreter, it does not nearly match
   the run-time performance of, for example, GHC or HBC.
