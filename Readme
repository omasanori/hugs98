   We are pleased to announce a new release of Hugs98, a Haskell 
   interpreter and programming environment for developing cool Haskell 
   programs.  Sources and binaries are freely available on the 
   World-Wide Web.

   The most important features of this new release are:
   
   - The incompatibilities between Hugs and the Haskell Graphics Library
     have been fixed, and binaries for the HGL are now available on the 
     Hugs download page.

   - The missing standard libraries Directory, CPUTime, Time and Locale 
     have been added along with a complete implementation of Haskell98 IO.

   - Hugs is now delivered with most of the hslibs libraries installed
     in the lib/exts/ directory.  The added modules cover the Edison, 
     Parsec, HaXml, QuickCheck, concurrent, monad, and html subdirectories 
     of hslibs.

   - The :set option now refuses the user to set a module search path
     that doesn't contain the Prelude. This is to protect users from
     accidentally rendering their Hugs setups unusable, esp. so on
     Windows machines where the options are persisted to the Registry.

   - MacOS X is now one of the supported unix ports, with pre-built 
     binaries available on the download page.

   - Experimental support is provided for hierarchical module names, 
     where a module name A.B.C is mapped onto the file path 
     A/B/C{.hs,.lhs} and appended to each of the path prefixes in 
     HUGSPATH until the name of a readable file is found.

   Most reported bugs have also been fixed; however, some issues still
   remain.  See the heading "Hugs Bugs & Features" on the Hugs web site
   for further information.
