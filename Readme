   We are pleased to announce a new release of Hugs98, an interpreter
   and programming environment for developing Haskell programs.
   Sources and binaries are freely available on the World-Wide Web.

   Feature highlights of this new release are:
   
   - Much improved FFI support (contributed by Alastair Reid), bringing
     Hugs really very close to the Haskell FFI specification.
   - Adoption of a significant subset of GHC's hierarchical libraries
     (hard work contributed by Ross Paterson.)
   - An (allegedly) complete implementation of the Haskell98 module
     system.
   - Numerous bug fixes since the previous major release in Dec 2001.

   The home page for Hugs is at http://haskell.org/hugs.
