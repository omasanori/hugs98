   We are pleased to announce an interim release of Hugs98, an interpreter
   and programming environment for developing Haskell programs.

   This release is primarily targeted at Unix systems to gain experience
   with new features.  The new Cabal-based library build system has the
   potential to make building on Windows easier, but it's not there yet.
   Volunteers welcome.

   Feature highlights of this new release are:

   - The default current module is now the empty module Hugs instead of
     the Prelude.
   - The Char type and the Char module now support Unicode as specified
     in the Haskell 98 Report (contributed by Dmitry Golubovsky).
   - The new -X option groups several options into one argument.
   - The syntax of the ffihugs command has changed: the +G and +L options
     are gone, and a new +i option can be used to specify include files.
   - Hugs now has basic support for Cabal.
   - Numerous bug fixes since the previous major release in Nov 2003.

   The home page for Hugs is at http://haskell.org/hugs.
