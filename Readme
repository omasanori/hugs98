   We are pleased to announce a new release of Hugs98, an interpreter
   and programming environment for developing Haskell programs.
   Sources and binaries are freely available on the World-Wide Web.

   Feature highlights of this new release are:
   
   - More of the hierarchical libraries, including imprecise exceptions
     and unboxed arrays, giving greater compatibility with GHC.
     For now, compatibility with the old libraries is provided by stub
     modules, but users are encouraged to migrate to the new libraries.
   - The Double type is now double-precision on most architectures.
   - The -e, -f, -i, -N, -W and -X options are gone, as is the :project
     command.
   - Integrated .NET support (on Windows).
   - The beginnings of a User's Guide (still somewhat incomplete).
   - Numerous bug fixes since the previous major release in Nov 2002.

   The home page for Hugs is at http://haskell.org/hugs.
