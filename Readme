   We are pleased to announce a new release of Hugs98, a Haskell 
   interpreter and programming environment for developing cool Haskell 
   programs.  Sources and binaries are freely available on the 
   World-Wide Web.

   The most important features of this new release are:
   
   - The incompatibilities between Hugs and the Haskell Graphics Library
     have been fixed, and binaries for the HGL are now available on the 
     Hugs download page.

   - The missing standard libraries Directory and Time have been 
     implemented.

   - Hugs is now delivered with most of the hslibs libraries installed
     in the lib/exts/ directory.

   - A new command :regsave is availiable under Windows, which persists 
     the current settings to the Registry.
     
   - Hugs now falls back to using the default HUGSPATH on Windows
     systems, should the user-specified path in the Registry not 
     contain a valid Prelude.

   - MacOS X is now one of the supported unix ports, with prebuilt 
     binaries avaliable on the download page.

   - Experimental support is provided for hierarchical module names, 
     where a module name A.B.C is mapped onto the file path 
     A/B/C{.hs,.lhs} and appended to each of the path prefixes in 
     HUGSPATH until the name of a readable file is found.

   Most reported bugs have also been fixed; however, some issues primarily
   related to functional dependencies still remain in this release.  See
   the heading "Hugs Bugs & Features" on the Hugs web site for further 
   information.
