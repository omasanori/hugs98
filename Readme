   We are pleased to announce a new beta release of Hugs98, a  
   Haskell interpreter and programming environment for developing 
   cool Haskell programs.  Sources and binaries are freely available
   by anonymous FTP and on the World-Wide Web.

   This release is largely conformant with Haskell 98, including
   monad and record syntax, newtypes, strictness annotations, and
   modules.  In addition, it comes packaged with the libraries defined
   in the most recent version of the Haskell Library Report and with
   extension libraries that are compatible with GHC 3.0 and later.

   This is a major release that incorporates bug fixes as well as 
   several new features and enhancements that have been developed for 
   Hugs over the last year. It is announced with the intentions that 
   it will remain a stable and lightweight implementation of Haskell 98 
   + extensions for some considerable time.

   A list of the most important new features looks as follows:

   - A Foreign Function Interface closely modelled after the one
     provided by GHC.

   - Built-in, Hood-like debugging support.
 
   - Parallel list comprehensions, a.k.a. zip-comprehensions.

   - A new syntax for recursive monad bindings.

   - A new GUI under Windows that doesn't consume all CPU time.

   - Support for the MacOS platform integrated into the main 
     distriution.

   - Corrections of all bugs reported for the January 2001 beta 
     release.

   See the release notes in the "docs" directory of the distribution
   for more information on the new language features.

   Hugs is best used as a Haskell program development system: it boasts
   extremely fast compilation, supports incremental compilation, and
   has the convenience of an interactive interpreter (within which one
   can move from module to module to test different portions of a
   program).  However, being an interpreter, it does not nearly match
   the run-time performance of, for example, GHC or HBC.
